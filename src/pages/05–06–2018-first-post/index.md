title: "Insights from Code Conference 2018"
---
The annual Code Conference continues to be the best place to hear first-hand accounts and insights from leaders across tech and media and often with a surprise or two cross-over guest.

The interviews are fun to watch (especially compared to participating!) and the post-interview lobby conversation can lead to some pretty good debates (like the one this year I had on anti-trust).

What distinguished this year’s conference from past years through were apologies — CEO and executive alike seemed to use the forum to apologize for something.
To reflect on this year’s conference I wanted to bring together in one place statements made in the interviews that I found most insightful, interesting, or thought-provoking a long with a brief reason why I thought that.

It seems as though the corporate world is going through a phase of apologizing for various mistakes or transgressions (linear TV has been running commercials from Facebook, Uber, and Wells Fargo to name a few). I ended up tracking those and because of the frequency I made note of them below.

Perhaps more so this year, there was also a pretty clear differences in how speakers that were founders dealt with tough issues compared to speakers that were senior operating executives, even if they were long-time employees. I might summarize this as follows:

Founders are often more interesting to listen to because they usually have a different view of risk (of being interviewed) and are much more interested in expressing a clear point of view, even when apologizing for something. In the list below, an asterisk* denotes a founder.
Operators can often be more interested in “surviving” the interview and getting across the point(s) they came to make. Usually they are ready with statistics or talking points that get repeated.
Even the most interesting speakers would be more interesting if they planned to be interesting by sharing something new or “news”. This is an “insider” conference and as such much might be “boring” to those that track a particular company. Personally, a suggestion is that more speakers choose to launch new products or make significant announcements in this forum simply because it is filled with insiders who come here with an open mind. The biggest and best companies have done so but then moved to first party events, but generally these are far less interesting than they used to be because they are so scripted.
